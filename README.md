# Ethereum Sweeper App

This repository contains the source code for an Ethereum Sweeper application built with JavaScript. The purpose of this application is to sweep available Ether (ETH) from one Ethereum address to another in within milliseconds

## How It Works

The Ethereum Sweeper app allows users to transfer ETH from one Ethereum address (sender) to another Ethereum address (recipient). This is particularly useful for consolidating funds or transferring ETH from multiple addresses to a single address.

## Features

- **Transfer ETH:** Transfer ETH from one Ethereum address to another.
- **Custom Gas:** Set custom gas price and gas limit for transactions.
- **Security:** Private keys are securely handled and never exposed to the server.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (Node.js):** Backend functionality and Ethereum transaction handling.
- **Web3.js:** Interact with the Ethereum blockchain to send transactions.
- **Ethers.js:** Ethereum wallet implementation for securely managing private keys.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
- Ethereum accounts with available ETH (sender and recipient).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. npm install
